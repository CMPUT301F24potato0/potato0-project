# EventLottery

Welcome to our app. Check out our [wiki](https://github.com/CMPUT301F24potato0/potato0-project/wiki) for more information

This is Fall 2024 CMPUT 301 Project.

**Event Lottery** is a mobile application designed to bring fairness and accessibility to event registration at community centers. Instead of relying on a "first-come, first-served" system, which can be stressful and exclusionary, Event Lottery uses a randomized lottery process to give everyone an equal opportunity to attend popular events.

### How It Works:

1. **Event Creation:** Organizers create events or series of events, such as swimming lessons or workshops, and set a signup period (e.g., one week).
2. **Join the Lottery:** Participants can register their interest during the signup window, joining a waiting list without the need to constantly monitor for openings.
3. **Random Selection:** Once the signup period ends, the app randomly selects participants to fill available spots. Selected participants (or their guardians) are notified and given the chance to confirm or decline their spot.
4. **Cancellations:** If someone cancels their spot, the system automatically draws another participant from the waiting list to fill the vacancy.
5. **Organizer Tools:** Organizers can monitor registrations, view the final list of attendees, and manage replacements seamlessly.

### Why Event Lottery?

By eliminating time-pressure-based registration, Event Lottery ensures a fair and inclusive experience for everyone. This system is especially beneficial for individuals with work schedules, disabilities, or other commitments, allowing them to participate without stress or barriers. 

Event Lottery promotes fairness, accessibility, and ease for both organizers and participants, making community events truly open to all.
